# The WSCCI Presentation

## About

This repository contains the ever-evolving slide deck for my WSCCI presentation
series.  Rather than redo it every time, since it's all HTML now I figure I
should just stick it in Git and use tags.  If you're looking for a version of
this presentation from a particular conference, look at the corresponding
conference tag.

These slides are created using <a href="https://github.com/Seldaek/slippy">Slippy</a>
by Jordi Boggiano.  It's the HTML presentationsystem I find I dislike least.
Give it a try. :-)

Note that the CSS is controlled using Sass.  If the CSS isn't displaying properly
for you, try regenerating it.  Consult your favorite Sass reference. for more
information.
